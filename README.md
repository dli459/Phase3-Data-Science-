# Phase3-Data-Science-

Advanced Features completed:

1: Apply hyperparameter tuning to our model to find out the best possible model compilation parameters for accuracy.

2: Make a python application/function that can evaluate our model when given any PNG and/or JPEG image. This application should is able to resize images to 32x32 before evaluation.



To load the final model, please use the following code

  from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

  model = load_model('final_model.h5')
